Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array
You are given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to remove duplicates from nums in-place so that each element appears only once.

After removing the duplicates, return the number of unique elements, denoted as k, such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements.

Note:

The order of the unique elements should remain the same as in the original array.
It is not necessary to consider elements beyond the first k positions of the array.
To be accepted, the first k elements of nums must contain all the unique elements.
Return k as the final result.
